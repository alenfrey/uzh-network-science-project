## Final Project Report

## Reproducing Structural measures of similarity and complementarity in complex networks

### Abstract

Write abstract last after the rest of the report is done.

### Introduction

The paper "Structural measures of similarity and complementatiry in complex networks" [1] proposes measures for determining if networks are formed by underlying mechanisms of similarity and/or complementarity. They attribute these properties to specific motifs, triangles for similarity and quadrangles for complementarity.
