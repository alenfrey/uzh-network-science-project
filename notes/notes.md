* pathcensus uses igraph library for creating graph objects, I might port this to networkx
* code to reproduce paper is available at https://github.com/sztal/scs-paper
  the best way to install the dependencies is via conda or miniconda since it depends
  on graph-tool and igraph.
* the similarity and complemtarity coefficients are for **undirected networks**
* we can contact the author of the paper and code by mail - stalaga@protonmail.com
