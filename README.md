## Abstract

The recent paper [Structural measures of similarity and complementarity in complex networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20710-w) describes algorithms for measuring properties of similarity and complementarity in networks. In the final project, we replicate the results of this paper and test the algorithms on additional social networks with differing scales.
